    <p><strong>This is a double-rise dough typical of Neapolitan pizza. Two different rise 
        methods are provided, one overnight in refrigerator and the other with a 
        sponge</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Prep Time: </strong><em>30 mins</em>     <strong>Cook Time: </strong><em>10 mins</em></p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
      <li>3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>OVERNIGHT COLD RISE METHOD: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Stir in 2 
        cups of flour and salt; mix well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, 
        beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out 
        onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 15 
        minutes. Place dough in bowl dusted with flour cover with plastic wrap and 
        refrigerate overnight.</li>
      <li>SPONGE RISE METHOD: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 
        1/2 cup water. Stir in 1/2 cup of flour; mix well. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until foamy, 
        about 1 hour. Blend in remaining water, flour and salt; beat well. When the 
        dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 
        until smooth and supple, about 15 minutes. Place dough in bowl dusted with 
        flour and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, about 2 to 3 hours.</li>
      <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough 
        into two equal pieces. Roll dough out to half of its final size. Let rest for 10 to 15 
        minutes (while you prepare desired pizza toppings). Preheat oven to 450 
        degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Stretch out dough over your floured knuckles and spin/toss 2 to 3 times until 
        desired size is achieved. Place dough on a baker's peel sprinkled with cornmeal 
        or a lightly greased pizza pan. Spread with desired toppings and bake on a pizza 
        stone in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked 
        pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.
