  <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>

  <ul>
    <li>1 cup of water</li>
    <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup of soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup pineapple juice</li>

  <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Whisk water, soy sauce, sugar, pineapple juice, vegetable oil, garlic, and ginger, 
        together in a large glass or ceramic bowl until sugar has dissolved. Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in 
        the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
    
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking dishes and set

    <li>Remove chicken wings from marinade; shake off excess and place the chicken 
        wings into the prepared baking dishes. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    
    <li>Bake chicken wings in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and 
        glaze is evenly browned, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
        into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
